üìù Production-Ready To-Do List: ForegroundAudioService for Background Audio Recording
1. Native Android Service Implementation (Java/Kotlin)
[ ] Create ForegroundAudioService class in android/app/src/main/java/com/yourapp/ForegroundAudioService.java or .kt
[ ] Add detailed comments to each function (what it gets, what it does, what it outputs)
[ ] Implement service lifecycle: onCreate, onStartCommand, onDestroy
[ ] Start service in foreground with a persistent notification
[ ] Handle audio recording start/stop using MediaRecorder or AudioRecord
[ ] Ensure service restarts if killed (use START_STICKY)
[ ] Handle microphone resource conflicts gracefully
[ ] Create a notification channel for Android 8.0+ (Oreo)
[ ] Customize notification text, icon, and actions
2. React Native Bridge (Native Module)
[ ] Create a Native Module (e.g., ForegroundServiceModule)
[ ] Expose methods to JS: startService, stopService, isServiceRunning
[ ] Add comments for each method (what it gets, what it does, what it outputs)
[ ] Ensure thread safety and error handling
[ ] Register the module in your app‚Äôs MainApplication.java/MainApplication.kt
3. Permissions and Manifest
[ ] Update AndroidManifest.xml
[x] Add <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
[x] Add <service ... android:foregroundServiceType="microphone" ... />
[ ] Add <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
[ ] Add <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /> (if saving files)
4. JS/TS Integration
[ ] Create a JS/TS wrapper for the native module (e.g., BackgroundAudioManager.ts)
[ ] Add methods to start/stop the service from React Native
[ ] Add comments for each function (what it gets, what it does, what it outputs)
[ ] Ensure all calls are promise-based and error-handled
[ ] Integrate with your recording flow
[ ] Start the foreground service before starting audio recording
[ ] Stop the service after recording is finished
[ ] Handle app lifecycle events (background/foreground/kill)
5. Testing and UX
[ ] Test on real devices (not just emulator)
[ ] Test background recording (app in background, screen off, app killed)
[ ] Test microphone conflicts (calls, other apps)
[ ] Test notification appearance and actions
[ ] Adjust notification text/icons for your branding
[ ] Add user feedback (optional: subtle indicator when recording is paused due to mic conflict)
6. Open/Closed Principle & Modularity
[ ] Keep all native code in separate files (no changes to existing JS/TS unless integrating the new manager)
[ ] Expose only necessary methods to JS/TS (no direct service logic in React Native)
[ ] Document all new code with clear comments for future maintainers
7. (Optional) Advanced Features
[ ] Handle service restarts after device reboot (use BroadcastReceiver)
[ ] Support for custom notification actions (pause/resume/stop from notification)
[ ] Audio file management (auto-save, cleanup, upload)
8. Documentation
[ ] Document all steps and code for future developers
[ ] Add README section for background audio recording setup
This checklist ensures a robust, modular, and future-proof implementation that will not interfere with your current app logic.
